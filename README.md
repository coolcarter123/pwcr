# Simple Password Cracker

This is a simple password cracker script written in Python that uses brute force to crack hashed passwords. It is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for any illegal or unethical activities.

**WARNING:** Using a password cracker without proper authorization is illegal and can lead to serious consequences. Always obtain explicit permission before attempting to crack passwords.

This script supports customization of the character set, minimum and maximum password length. However, it can be easily defeated by using strong, long passwords or more advanced hash functions.

Use this script responsibly and at your own risk.
